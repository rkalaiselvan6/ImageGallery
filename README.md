# ImageGallery
An ImageGallery Application using C# with .Net Core 2.1.
  A test project using .Net Core 2.1 which uses entity framework core for data access with SQL Server and running on IIS server. 
  DataStore library contains the entity framework codes for the image related objects and takes a connection string to the local SQLserver database.
  //TODO: planning to add bunch of URIs to the images stored in Azure blob storage and displaying it with our application.
